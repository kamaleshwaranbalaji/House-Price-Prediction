# House Price Prediction 

This project explores the use of machine learning models for predicting house prices. It compares the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression on a house price dataset.

## Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handles categorical features and splits data into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Trains Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict house prices based on various features.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the models' performance using R-squared score on the training data. (Note: Ideally, evaluate on unseen test data as well.)

## Results:

* This project demonstrates a significant improvement in R-squared score by using Random Forest compared to Linear Regression.
* While the provided code shows a hypothetical improvement from 68% to 94%, the actual improvement will depend on the specific dataset used.

## Further Exploration:

* Evaluate model performance on unseen test data.
* Explore hyperparameter tuning for both models.
* Implement other regression algorithms for comparison.
* This project provides a foundation for understanding how machine learning models can be applied to real estate price prediction. With further exploration and enhancements, it can be a valuable tool for estimating house prices.
